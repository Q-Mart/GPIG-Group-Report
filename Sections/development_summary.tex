A summary of the development, including group performance, and those aspects of the group organisation that worked well and those that, with hindsight, would have been tackled differently

\section{Group Organisation}
We decided not to have a set team leader as we felt it was not necessary for such a small team, and it would allow each member to have an equal voice within the team.  One team member was chosen to act as a point of contact between the team and the project clients. One team member volunteered for this role, therefore they were automatically selected. Another team member was selected to communicate with the other teams, so that each team's solution could be integrated into our own. Once again, only one team member volunteered and was chosen for this role.

A Slack \cite{slack} channel was created so that the team could communicate outside of meetings and also allow future meetings to be organised. A GitHub \cite{github} repository was created to store software written for the project. Google Drive \cite{googledrive} was used to store and share all other documents, such as system architecture drawings.
