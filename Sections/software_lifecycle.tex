\section{Requirements Analysis}

Some general requirements have been made directly from the initial brief (marked as B below), which were then extended to include those that our prototype solution requires (marked as P). The aim was to show as many elements of our final solution as possible. Due to the cost and time it would take to prototype a satellite, this was left out of the prototype goals. Each other element in the system will be demonstrated to some level of implementation as this was achievable within the timeframe, budget and skills of the team. 

An evaluation of which requirements were implemented was done at each weekly meeting to ensure timely progress and allowed the group to focus on the requirements that had not yet been implemented rather than adding extra functionality. 
    
\textbf{Hardware}
\begin{enumerate}
\item There must be a demonstration of a locking mechanism (P)
\item The locking mechanism must unlock with only one key (P)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Backend}
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item There must be a connection to a Redis database from the application (P)
\item Route planning must be implemented (B)
\item Constraints must be incorporated within the final route plan (P)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Courier View}
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item There must be step-by-step guidance from the origin to the destination (B)
\item There must be a way to communicate with the control room (P)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Customer View}
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item The customer must be able to see the ETA of the package (P)
\item The customer must be able to see the current status of the delivery (P)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Control Room View}
\begin{enumerate}[resume]

\item The supervisor must be able to view all couriers (P)
\item The supervisor must be able to view all customers (P)
\item The supervisor must be able to view all deliveries (P)
\item The supervisor must be able to view a map showing all couriers (P)
\item The supervisor must be able to add couriers/customers/deliveries (P)
\item The supervisor must be able to add constraints to everyone/customers/deliveries (P)
\item The supervisor must be able to communicate with the courier

\end{enumerate}

Requirements 1 and 2 were generated due to the reasoning in Section \ref{databasearch}. The need for requirement 3 comes from the importance of storing the information used throughout the rest of the application - information regarding customers, deliveries, couriers, messages and constraints are all stored here. Redis was the database of choice due to its enhanced security features detailed in Section \ref{databasearch} and as it is easy to setup. Requirements 4 and 6 came directly from the original brief detailing the need of a "routing system capable of guiding a courier “step by step”. 

Requirements 5 and 15 come from the system being mission-critical which means it is essential for the package to reach its final destination. The ability to constrain the route enables both the customer and the controller to tell the routing system to avoid certain areas and also ensure the destination is reached in time. Requirements 7 and 16 ensure that the courier has up to date information regarding the routing and also means any specific information can be sent in text for clarification. The courier can also let the control room know of any possible routing implications that have not been picked up by the mapping API or whether they are in any imminent danger. 

Requirements 8 and 9 are necessary as this is what the customer will see and enables the demonstration to show all aspects of the application.

Requirements 10-13 allow the supervisor in the control room to have a full overview of the system and which deliveries are active and how they are all progressing. Requirement 14 means they can add new information in to the frontend which will then update the Redis database. This allows all supervisors to have the same information displayed to them and again, allows full control. If this system was taken forwards and brought to market, it may be worthwhile implementing different levels of access for supervisors as they may eventually have different roles to each other. E.g. maybe some supervisors are responsible for verifying routes/managing risks where as some have a more administrative role of adding couriers/deliveries.




\section{Design}

As part of designing the final solution, a risk assessment was performed. This enabled the team to develop our initial ideas into something more concrete, ensuring major risks to the whole system including the courier, briefcase and communication were taken in to account, as when combined, securing these parts of the system ensures that the packages reach their final destination. The risk assessment findings were documented in a risk register table as seen in Table \ref{tab:riskRegister}.

The risk register scores each risks based on two factors - Impact (I) and Likelihood (L) to give an overall score of Severity (S). Each risk is given an ID which contains a unique number and what the risk applies to/comes from. The categories are as follows: Communication/Transport (C), Briefcase (B), Courier  (M) or General (G). Each of these is rated on a scale of 1 to 5 where 5 is very likely/has a high impact/is very severe, these are also colour coordinated to represent the risk to the project/product. Each risk has a risk status which can either be Identified (I), Controlled/Accepted (C) or Resolved (R). The risks to the project itself are shown within Appendix \ref{tab:projectrisks}, these were considered to ensure completion of the prototype, report and presentation to a high standard.
